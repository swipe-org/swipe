#Swipe & Swipe Engine

##What is Swipe?

Swipe is a **domain-specific, declarative language** for non-developers (such as designers, animators, illustrators, musicians, videographers and comic writers) to create **media-rich/animated documents** that contain photos, videos, images, vector graphics, animations, voices, musics and sound effects, which will be consumed on touch-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets and touch-enabled set-top-boxes (such as **iPhone and Apple TV**). 

##What is Swipe Engine?

Swipe Engine is the **viewer** of documents described in Swipe. Since it supports hyperlinking and allows you to browse fron one Swipe document to another, you could even call it a **domain-specific browser**. At this moment (October 2015), Swipe Engine is avalable for **iOS and tvOS**, but will be ported to other platforms such as Android, Windows and even HTML5 (and we are looking for volunteers to do so). 

##Why do we need Swipe?

Because existing platforms (such as HTML5, ePub, Flash and iBooks) require some form of programming to create media-rich/animated documents, which is expensive and error-prone. HTML used be a simple declarative language, but became a full-brown programming environment with DOM and JavaScript. Flash took the same path with the introduction of ActionScript. 

That's why I came to the conclusion that it's time to design a new platform, which is powerful enough to describe media-rich documents that allow us to take full advantage of modern devices, but is also **strictly declarative** (no API, no script), easy to read, easy to write and easy to auto-generate. 

##Why is it open?

Because I want to make it an industry standard so that everybody can benefit from it. I was lucky enough to work on several successful products, such as Windows 95, which were used by hundreds of millions of people. I'd like to see such a success again.

##Is it really free?

Yes, I still maintain the copyright, but it's **absolutely free**. You can use it for non-commercial and commercial applications, modify it as needed, port it to other platforms (I'd really apprecaite if you open source it as well), re-distribute it with your applications, as long as you explicitly mention that your application uses Swipe and recognize me (Satoshi Nakajima) as the copyright holder.
